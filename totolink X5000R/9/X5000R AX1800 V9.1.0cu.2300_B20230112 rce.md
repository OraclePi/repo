### Vulnerability:

This vulnerability is a Remote Code Execution (RCE) that allows attackers to make arbitrary command execution

The vulnerability is located in the function `sub_4136DC` within `cstecgi.cgi`, also known as `setPortForwardRules`.

The function uses `Uci_Set_Str`, which passes the parameter `enable` as the fourth argument. In `libcscommon.so`,it can be observed that `Uci_Set_Str` calls `snprintf` to format our `param_4` into the string `uci -c %s set ....` and passes the string to the `CsteSystem` function,which will eventually be called by `execv`.

therefore , by controlling parameter `enable` , we can finally make an arbitrary command execution

### POC:
To reproduce the vulnerability, you can use the actual device or simulate it using qemu. The following POC can be used:

~~~

(tips:if you use qemu emulation ur likely to patch a few places to work normally)
### Impact:

though there is an error msg , the command has indeed been executed
