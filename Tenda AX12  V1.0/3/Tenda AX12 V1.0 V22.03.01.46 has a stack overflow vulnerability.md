### **Vulnerability**:
The vulnerability is located in `/goform/SetStaticRouteCfg` where the request parameter list does not have a length limitation, which can ultimately lead to a stack overflow.
The vulnerable function `sub_43B6BC` is present in the `httpd` file within the `sub_41DE60 function`.

By passing the request parameter list to `sub_43B3C4`, as shown in the figure below:

As we can see, the request parameter `list` is passed to the variable `v3`, and since there is no length restriction on the variable `v3`, the subsequent `sscanf` function separates the value of `v3` using commas as delimiters and assigns them to `v16, v18, v19, v20`. These variables only require a certain length of padding to cause a stack overflow, which can easily lead to a denial of service attack. Furthermore, by constructing a suitable exploit, it is possible to gain shell access. The vulnerability is depicted in the following image:
